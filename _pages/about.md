About Me
======
Hai, I am currently a graduate student, doing my masters at Boston University. I am being advised by ![Dr. Margrit Betke](https://www.cs.bu.edu/faculty/betke/).
My current area of research is on pattern recognition, and image understanding of different MRI scans for different tasks related to Aphasia in collaboration with Aphasia Lab, Boston University. 

<!-- I am a graduate **(Masters)** student at Boston University. I joined here in Fall 2021 and I will be graduating at Spring 2023. 
I am currently working with ___ and ___ and I feel thankful to be working and learning to conduct reasearch with them. I love to read and talk about vision and language deep learning models and approaches, and I feel excited to learn more about the whole region of Artificial Intelligence. I am looking forward to explore reinforcement learning after a while.  -->

<!-- About Me
====== -->
Hai, I am currently a masters student at Boston University in my third semester.  

I am being advised by [Dr. Margrit Betke](https://www.cs.bu.edu/faculty/betke/). 
My current area of research is on pattern recognition, and image understanding of different MRI scans for different tasks related to Aphasia in collaboration with [Aphasia Research Lab](https://www.bu.edu/aphasiaresearch/), Boston University. This work is jointly being collaborated with [Dr. Prakash Ishwar](https://sites.bu.edu/pi/), [Dr. Archana Venkataraman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/archana-venkataraman-340632219?original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F) and [Dr. Swathi Kiran](https://www.bu.edu/sargent/profile/swathi-kiran-ph-d-ccc-slp/) 

Before Joining Boston University, I was an undergraduate student in the department of Engineering Sciences at IIT Hyderabad.

During my Undergraduate at IIT Hyderabad, I worked with the following people on mentioned projects

- I worked with Dr. [K Sri Rama Murthy](https://www.iith.ac.in/ee/ksrm/), [Dr. Venkatesham](https://sites.google.com/mae.iith.ac.in/venkatesham?pli=1) and [Dr. Siva Teja golla](https://in.linkedin.com/in/sivatejagolla) on Sloshing Noise analysis and classification in Fuel tanks of Hybrid Vehicles.
  - We published our work on [Journal of Acoustic Society of America](https://asa.scitation.org/journal/jas)
  - [Identification of sloshing noises using convolutional neural network](https://asa.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1121/10.0004829)
      


What I like
======
I like to work on Reinforcement Learning, NLP and Vision. Although my current works are not related in this area, i am looking for a transition for my PhD.

I like Japan

My greatest failure, and resolve. 
======
Back in 2019, I was awarded a scholarship by [Japan Internation Cooperation Agency](https://www.jica.go.jp/english/index.html)(JICA) to study for my masters at any university in Japan. 

  - I was admitted to [Matsuo lab](https://weblab.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/), School of Engineering, Tokyo University, under [Dr. Yutaka Matsuo](http://ymatsuo.com/). Which was a huge honour to be admitted.
  - Financial condition was bad at home, to an extent I had to intervene and help at home by working. I tried to defer my admission for one year, but I cannot defer according to the scholarship agreement.
  - So, with a heavy heart, I had to give up the scholarship and take up a job to support my family.

My entire life trajectory would have been different had I dared and pursued my masters at Tokyo University. 

I made a promise to myself to complete my masters at Boston University and go to Matsuo lab and do my Ph.D.

I am a graduate (Masters) student at Boston University. I joined here in Fall 2021 and I will be graduating at Spring 2023. 
I am currently working with ___ and ___ and I feel thankful to be working and learning to conduct reasearch with them. I love to read and talk about vision and language deep learning models and approaches, and I feel excited to learn more about the whole region of Artificial Intelligence. I am looking forward to explore reinforcement learning after a while. 

What I like
======

I love to explore new places anywhere I am, and I love Japan. I was in Japan for a short time(2 months) back in 2019 and I fell in love with that place. I would love to talk more about my experiences there as an undergraduate intern working at one of the oldest companies ever on earth(Takenaka Corpoation). I felt like that was the turning moment of my life until covid came and undid lot of plans
